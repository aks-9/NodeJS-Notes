/*
RUN node events.js 

OUTPUT:

There was a new sale!
Customer name: Jonas
There are now 9 items left in stock.
Waiting for requests...


=> So, we see "Waiting for request..."", and the application is not shutting down, and now we know it's not shutting down because the event loop is still waiting for incoming I/O.


So now if we go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/, we will see:

There was a new sale!
Customer name: Jonas
There are now 9 items left in stock.
Waiting for requests...
Request received!
Another request ðŸ˜€



=> In this case, of course, we have to emit the events ourself, but if we're using a built in node module, then these functions in there will many times emit their own events, and all we have to do is to listen to them.
