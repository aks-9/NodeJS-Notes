So right now, in the 'package.json' file we have 'start: nodemon server.js', but I also want to add another one for production just so that we can test what happens in that situation.



"scripts": {
    "start:dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "start:prod": "SET NODE_ENV=production&& nodemon server.js"
  },
  
  So in production we simply want to set the 'NODE_ENV' variable to 'production'.
  
  So run:
  
  npm run start:prod
  
  And so now you see that our 'NODE_ENV' variable is actually set to production.
  
  And if now do a request from Postman, we will then not get our logger in the console: 
  production
  App running on 3000...
  Hello from the middleware ðŸ‘‹

  Let's go back to our development script, so 'npm run start:dev' and this time when we make a request from Postman, we will get our logger back:

  development
App running on 3000...
Hello from the middleware ðŸ‘‹
