The data that the client actually receives, or that the server receives from the client, is usually the JSON Data Format.

JSON is a very lightweight data interchange format which is heavily used by web APIs coded in any programming language.

In JSON, unlike JavaScript Object, all the keys have to be strings. It's also very typical for the values to be strings as well but they can be other things like numbers, true or false values, other object, or even arrays of other values.


RESPONSE FORMATTING

We could send the data back to the client as it is, but we usually do some simple response formatting before sending.

 There are a couple of standards for this and we're gonna use a very simple one called "Jsend".

We simply create a new object, then add a status message to it in order to inform the client whether the request was a success, fail or error, and then we put our original data into a new object called Data.

Wrapping the data into an additional object like we did here is called Enveloping, and it's a common practice to mitigate some security issues and other problems.



==> A RESTful API should always be stateless.

A state simply refers to a piece of data in the application that might change over time.

In a stateless RESTful API, all state is handled on the client and not on the server.

The fact that the state should be handled on the client means that each request must contain all the information that is necessary to process a certain request on the server. So, the server should never ever have to remember the previous request in order to process the current request.
