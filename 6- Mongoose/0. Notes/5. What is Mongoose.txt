What actually is Mongoose? 

Mongoose is an 'Object Data Modeling' library for MongoDB and Node JS, providing a higher level of abstraction. 

So, it's a bit like the relationship between Express and Node, so Express is a layer of abstraction over regular Node, while Mongoose is a layer of abstraction over the regular MongoDB driver. 

An 'Object Data Modeling' is just a way for us to write JavaScript code that will then interact with a database. 

Mongoose gives us a lot more functionality out of the box over the regular MongoDB driver, allowing for faster and simpler development of our applications. 

Some features that Mongoose gives: 
1. Schemas to model our data and relationship, 
2. Easy data validation, 
3. A simple query API, 
4. Middleware


In Mongoose, a 'schema' is where we describe the structure of the data, default values, and validation. We then take that 'schema' and create a model out of it. 

And the 'model' is basically a wrapper around the 'schema', which allows us to actually interface with the database in order to create, delete, update, and read documents.
