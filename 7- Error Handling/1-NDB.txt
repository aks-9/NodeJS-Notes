sudo npm i ndb --global

or 

npm i ndb --save-dev

add ndb to the scripts tag in the package.json file

"debug": "ndb server.js"


Now run:
npm run debug

This will then open a headless chrome debugger.

We can add breakpoints in this debugger, and then right click and select 'run script'. It will run till the breakpoint only. 

We can then look at the value of the variables at the breakpoint, and then 'resume script' to complete it. When we send a query from Postman, it will be visible in the Console of the debugger.
