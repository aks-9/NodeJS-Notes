1. There are two types of packages/dependencies: simple and development.

Simple/Regular packages/dependencies: 
These are simply packages that contain some code, that we will include in our own code. So it's the code upon which we built our own application.
eg. express, slugify(tool to make more readable URLs  out of names).


2. INSTALLING A REGULAR PACKAGE

npm install slugify

This will create a new field in package.json file:

 "dependencies": {
    "slugify": "^1.6.5"
  }



3. Development packages/dependencies: 
These are tools for development. e.g code bundler like Webpack, or a debugger tool, or a testing library. They are not needed for production, so our code doesn't really depend on them. We simply use them to develop our applications.

e.g Nodemon is a tool that automatically restart our node application whenever we make any changes to the file in our working directory.

npm install nodemon --save-dev

This will create a new field in package.json file:

devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15"
  }
