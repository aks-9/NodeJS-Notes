1. Open a folder in a code editor, go to its terminal and write the following to start the node:

node


2. You can define varibles and perform other JS operations like:

> const name = 'jonas'

> name
'jonas'

> 7+3
10



3. To exit the node process: 

> .exit or use CTRL + D


4. To clear the terminal write:
> clear or use  CTRL + L


5. Start the node again, and hit the 'tab' button twice. This will show you all the global varibles available in node.


6. You can use an underscore " _ " to perform operation on the previous output. e.g. 3*8 = 24. We can add 6 to 24 by using _+6 to the previous output.

> 3*8
24
> _+6
30


7. When you use a constructor like "String." and then hit the "tab" button, it will show all the methods available in node for that constructor.

> String.
String.__proto__             String.hasOwnProperty
String.isPrototypeOf         String.propertyIsEnumerable
String.toLocaleString        String.valueOf

String.apply                 String.arguments
String.bind                  String.call
String.caller                String.constructor
String.toString

String.fromCharCode          String.fromCodePoint
String.length                String.name
String.prototype             String.raw
