Download the MongoDB community server from the website.

Start the installer, and make sure to install MongoDB as a service. Also allow to install Mongoose.

Once the installation is done, go to C directory, and create a new folder called 'data'. Inside it, create another new folder called 'db'.

Now go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin 

and copy the path.

Open the powershell window and write:
cd 'C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin' and press enter


use 'dir' command to list all the files.

next write .\mongod.exe to start the MongoDB server.


Now we need a shell to connect to the server, to be able to manipulate our database.

Now again go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin

use .\mongo.exe to start a shell.


write 'db' and press enter,

it should return 'test'


use ctrl + c to close the process.



To start 'mongod.exe' from any directory, we need to edit the system variables.

Go to settings, search 'env'. Select 'edit system variables'.

Then select 'Environment Varibles' button.

Under the system variables, select 'Path'.

Click 'New' button, and paste C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin

Click okay.

Now you can open powershell from any directory and 'mongod.exe' will start the server.
