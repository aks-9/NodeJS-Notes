[ 1. Delete multiple documents in a collection ]

We will now delete all the tours that have rating less than '4.8'.

db.tours.deleteMany({ rating: {$lt: 4.8} })

OUTPUT:

{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 } 


[ 2. Delete All documents in a collection ]

To delete all the documents, we have to pass an empty object.

db.tours.deleteMany({})
