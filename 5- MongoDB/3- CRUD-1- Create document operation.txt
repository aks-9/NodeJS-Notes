[ 1. Creating multiple documents ]

> db.tours.insertMany([ {}, {} ])


So 'insertMany' is gonna accept an array of multiple objects. 

Remember, MongoDB documents are very flexible. And so they do not all have to have the same structure. So we can have different fields in different documents.

> db.tours.insertMany([ { name: "The Sea Explorer", price: 497, rating: 4.8 }, { name: "The Snow Adventurer", price: 997, rating: 4.9, difficulty: "easy" } ])

This will give us the following output:

{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedIds" : [
                ObjectId("62862bafc7a342f60b118c23"),
                ObjectId("62862bafc7a342f60b118c24")
        ]
}

so we have inserted two new documents, and here we see the IDs that they got.
