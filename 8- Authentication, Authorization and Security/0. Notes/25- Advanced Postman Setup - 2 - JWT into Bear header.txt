Automate the process of copying JWT token and pasting it into 'Authorization' header

Go to the 'Sign Up' request, and then go to the 'Tests' tab. Here we will programmatically set an environment variable for the json web token that we receive in the request.

On the RHS, you will find 'SNIPPETS'. Click on 'set an environment variable', and edit the code to this:

pm.environment.set("jwt", pm.response.json().token);


Make sure you're in development environment. Now when we sign up a new user, we will get a new token in the output, and it will also be available automatically in our environment.


Now go to the protected routes "Get All Tours" and get rid of the whole 'Authorization' row, and instead click on 'Authorization' tab and select 'TYPE' as 'Bearer Token'. Finally in the 'Token' field, write {{jwt}}

Now when we make a new request,
if everything works, in the headers tab, you will see the 'authorization' field with 'bearer token' as its value.


Do the same for the 'login' request.
