Postman environments

An environment is like a context where our app is running. And, we can then specify a couple of variables for each of these environments. And, the two major ones that make the most sense are, the development and the production environment.

Create an environment for development

Dev: Natours
Variable: URL
Initial value: http://127.0.0.1:3000/

and one for production:

Prod: Natours
Variable: URL
Initial value: natours.io

Now we'll replace 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/' from our every request we have created so far with {{URL}}
